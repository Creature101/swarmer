# Swarmer

Swarmer treats swarm similar to a dev dependency. Add a `swarmer.yml` file to your directory and then simply run `swarmer start`.

## Installation

`go get github.com/MainframeHQ/swarmer` or clone and build manually.

Other means of installation may be provided in the future for those without a Golang environment already setup.

## Usage

Swarmer can be invoked either with a Yaml file describing the Swarm nodes, or by using command line flags.

To get started quickly, see the `swarmer.yml` file in this repo as an example to get started.

For command line usage have a look at the output from `swarmer help`.
